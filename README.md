qualApp
=======

A web app designed to ease the pain of studying for the physics departmental exam at UCSD. This project is general enough to be used for any test where historical records are available.

Latest release running at <a href="http://bit.ly/qualApp">bit.ly/qualApp</a> (which is still linked to svn repo on google code - hiss boo)
